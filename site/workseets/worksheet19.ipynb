    "This lesson deals with [gym openai](https://gym.openai.com/). OPenAI Gym provides a rich set of libraries and environments to try our algorithms on. These include the Atari games the DQN used in their Nature [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DQN/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) to show that Deep Reinforcement Learning can supersede human performance on Atari games with the *same* generic model that is used in *all* of the presented games. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was a big and important breakthrough since, previously, RL applications stayed largely within simpler control environments and required, as it was customary at that time, manual feature extraction. So, when this paper showed that it is feasible to build an end-to-end RL model that can automatically extract useful features that can be used directly in an RL training algorithm without any human engineering or intervention, it was an important landmark in our field. Prior to that, there was the Tesauro Backgammon [TDGammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon) as another success story which used a neural network to train a model to learn to play backgammon (see the chapter for more details). \n",
    "\n",
    "From that moment on, DeepMind went into a progressive trajectory of successful research and applications in the domain of deep reinforcement learning that reached an unprecedented level of beating the world champion in the game of Go see AlphaGo [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ) and then moved on to create a generic architecture that is capable of self-playing to reach superhuman levels in chess, Go and shogi that they called AlphaZero. Contrary to AlphaGo, AlphaZero did not use any human knowledge to train the model, and it completely started from scratch and let the AI train itself by itself! see [here](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even the replay idea is an old idea in RL it just got rehashed and done a bit differently inside a buffer that allows us to conduct learning in mini-batches similar to what we do in supervised learning (since this was tried and tested by the ML community and it is proven to work very well with backpropagation).\n",
    "Yet, this idea was not new since other researchers have tried batches with RL. The paper's main flair is the impressive performance level that could be achieved via an adequately long period of training, a foot that has not been achieved before.\n",
    "Note that the replay buffer dictates the choice of an off-policy algorithm i.e. Q-learning, since the replayed experience is old and the agent will be learning from a policy different to the one it pursues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect this trajectory to continue and that RL with robotics will create the next wave of innovation that will hopefully change how we conduct our daily lives. We hope this will lead to positive changes and prosperity in the long run, but that does not prevent mistakes. You will tackle this ethical side in another module. For now, enjoy dealing with the revolutionary side of AI that will change the world!\n",

    "#  OpenAI Gym Atari Games Environments\n",

To be able to follow the logic it is better if you read the Nature paper since most tutorial follow the deep learning architecture that the paper presented. Note that the deep neural network architecture is just three CNNs, nevertheless the paper pioneered and showed the effectiveness of combing deep learning with reinforcement learning. The paper has few inventions such as the experience replay buffer and the batch training something which had not been done successfully before in RL in such a context. The main contribution is to prove that RL is generic enough to be applied to learn from images just as human learn to play a game. Note that the algorithm needed to be an off-policy because of the usage of the experience replay buffer. The use of experience replay means that the agent is learning its current policy from an old experience that stemmed from following an old policy (previous version of its current policy). \n",

We have equipped our environment with necessary video storing as well as with pre-processing and to be able to handle the frames of the Gym environment. Note that we are dealing with environments that do not perform skipping to avoid the stochasticity associated with randomly applying actions. Therefore, we had to do the frame skipping in the wrapper class. It is also sufficient to deal with grey scale images not RGB since this will reduce the processing demands on our machines.

    "# RL with Deep Learning \n",
    "It is time to extend our basic MRP class to handle function approximation using deep neural networks.\n",
    "Note that in their paper DeepMinds trained for 200M frames, we set the max_t_exp (used in stop_exp() function) to 2M due to hardware limitation. We can also make the stop_exp() tied to R-star that is specific to the game under consideration. For example, in Pong, we can set this to 18. This means that on average (for the last 100 or 200 games/episodes), the opponent could only score *only a max of 3* goals, and our agent scores the wining *21* goals."

    "### Buffer Implementation\n",
    "It is better to implement the buffer as queue because it guarantees an O(1) complexity for append() and pop() and it is preferred over the list which gives us a O(n) for adding and retrieving an item. In Python we can utilise the double queue structure which gives us the flexibility to add and retrieve from both ends of the queue. Below, we show a quick example. Note that the buffer will be overwritten when. the number of items exceeds its length. This is useful for us because we just want the buffer to overwritten with new experience after it s full and to be kept updated accordingly."

    "In this lesson you saw how to deal with a continuous state space using function approximation and how to apply previous concepts on a more difficult control problems. We have built a wrapper class that allowed us to take advantage of the environments provided by OpenAI Gym library. We have duplicated what we have done in the previous lesson in order to 1. examine that our previous environment worked well, 2. see an example of how to deal with OpenAI Gym environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have also seen how to combine deep learning with reinforcement learning to create a powerful model that is capable of learning from watching a game. This is really interesting since it opens up the possibility for enormous applications where an agent can watch and learn to arrive to a complex behaviour that allows it to accomplish a task or win a competition. \n"

We hope that this will lead to positive changes and to prosperity in the long run but that does not prevent mistakes. You will tackle this ethical side in another module, for now enjoy dealing with revolutionary side of AI that will change the world!\n",
