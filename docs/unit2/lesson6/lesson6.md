In this lesson, we develop the ideas of Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods are powerful and widely used in settings other than RL. You may have encountered them in a previous module where they were mainly used for sampling. We will also use them here to sample observations and average their expected returns. Because they average the returns, Monte Carlo methods have to wait until *all* trajectories are available to estimate the return. Later, we will find out that Temporal Difference methods do not wait until the end of the episode to update their estimate and outperform MC methods.

Note that we have now moved to *learning* instead of *computing* the value function and its associated policy. This is because we expect our agent to learn from *interacting with the environment* instead of using the dynamics of the environment, which is usually hard to compute except for a simple lab-confined environment. 

Remember that we are dealing with *expected return*, and we are either finding an *exact solution for this expected return* as when we solve the set of Bellman equations or finding an *approximate solution for the expected return* as in DP or MC.
Remember also that the expected return for a state is the future cumulative discounted rewards given that the agent follows a specific policy.

One pivotal observation that summarises the justification for using MC methods over DP methods is that it is often the case that we are able to interact with the environment instead of obtaining its dynamics due to tractability issues.

## Plan

As usual, in general, there are two types of RL problems that we will attempt to design methods to deal with 
1. Prediction problem
For These problems, we will design Policy Evaluation Methods that attempt to find the best estimate for the value function given a policy.


2. Control problems 
For These problems, we will design Value Iteration methods that utilise Generalised Policy Iteration. They attempt to find the best policy by estimating an action-value function for a current policy and then moving to a better and improved one by often choosing a greedy action. They minimise an error function to improve their value function estimate, used to deduce a policy.
We will then move to Policy Gradient methods that directly estimate a useful policy for the agent by maximising its value function.


We start by assuming that the policy is fixed. This will help us develop an algorithm that predicts the state space's value function (expected return). Then we will move to the policy improvement methods, i.e. these methods that help us to compare and improve our policy with respect to other policies and move to a better policy when necessary. Then we move to the control case (policy iteration methods).

## First visit MC Policy-evaluation (prediction) 
Value-function approximation Method

Because MC methods depend entirely on experience, a natural way to approximate the cumulative future discounted reward is by taking their average once they become available through experience. So we must collect the cumulative *future* discounted reward once this experience has elapsed. In other words, we need to take the sum *after* the agent has finished an episode for all the rewards obtained from the current state to the end of the episode. Then we average those returns over all of the available episodes. 

Note that MC methods only apply for episodic tasks, which is one of its limitations in addition to having to wait until the episode is finished.

Note also that the agent can visit the same state more than once inside the same episode. We can take the sum starting from the first visit, or every visit, each yields a different algorithm. The first-visit algorithm is more suitable for tabular methods, while the every-visit algorithm is more suitable when using function approximation methods (such as neural networks).

## MRP environment for prediction

To be able to develop the methods of MC we would need to develop an MRP and MDP classes that is able to interact and collect experience from an environment for prediction and control, respectively. Below we show the skeleton of this class. But first we show some efficiency comparisons, you may skip directly to the MRP class [section](#MRP-Class-for-prediction).



### MRP Class for prediction
In the following class, we will try to build a useful and generic MDP/MRP class that will serve our different needs in various RL coverage steps. In particular, we want the interact() and the steps() functions to be as flexible and generic as possible. Towards that end, we have constructed our class to have the following sections:

1. Initialisation part: initialises the different variables necessary for our treatment
2. Buffer storage section: store experience
3. Steps section: takes a step in the environment and stores its correspondent dynamic (r,s,a). We have two types of steps: step_a(), suitable for most algorithms, and step_an(), which requires knowing the next action in advance. These two are useful in unifying the treatment of different RL algorithms, including prediction and control. For example, TD (prediction) and Q-learning(control) have a similar algorithm structure that entails using step_a(), while the Sarsa algorithm (control) uses step_an(). You will see these algorithms in the next lesson. Just be aware that you might want to change the default step function, step_a(), if your algorithm needs to know the next action, designated as *an*, to update its value function estimation.
4. Interact section: this part is the heart and soul of our class. It runs several episodes, each with several steps, until a goal is reached, a buffer is full, or some other condition is met.
5. Policy section: this is a set of policies according to which the agent will act. They can be either stationary (i.e., their probabilities do not change) or non-stationary (i.e., their probability will vary with Q, our action-value-function estimation).
6. Metric section: to measure the performance of our algorithms. Basically, we use three metrics: 
- the number of steps an agent took to reach a goal
- the sum of rewards an agent collected during an episode
- the root mean squared error of the value function estimation and the true values of an MDP or MTRP problem. This metric implies that we know a solution for a prediction in advance.
7. Visualisation functions can be overridden in children's classes as per our needs.



We defined a form of Markov Decision Process-MDP called Markov Reward Process-MRP. Like an MDP, an MRP is a stochastic process that concentrates on the rewards and states only and neutralizes the effect of actions. It is useful to study the predictive capabilities of an RL method where there are no decisions(actions) to be taken, and only we try to guess(predict) the returns of a process. 

Whenever there is a predictive algorithm, we will use **MRP**, while when we develop a control algorithm, we will use **MDP**. 

A typical example of an MRP is a random walk process, where an agent randomly moves left or right in a straight line of cells. A terminal state is at the end of each direction (left and right). The agent can be rewarded differently in each cell. Often, we reward the agent for moving to the far-right terminal state by 1 and everywhere else with 0. Another type of reward is to give the agent a negative -1 penalty on the far-left terminal state and 1 on the far-right state, and 0 everywhere else. See page 125 of the book.

Note that the only assumption about the environment is to provide a reset() and a step() functions that abide by the following general form:
1. reset() must return a value of the initial state with a proper representation. So, when we move to function approximation, it must return a vector representing the state.
2. step() must return four values,  the first is the state (observation) that is compatible with what is returned by reset(). The second is the reward for the current state, and the third is a flag to signal the end of an episode; usually, when the agent achieves the required task or fails for some reason, each would have a corresponding suitable reward. A fourth is an empty dictionary of information we provided for compatibility with openAI environments.

Let us now move to define our 1st-visit Monte Carlo *prediction* method. This method averages the return for only the first visit of a state in each episode.


```python

class MC1st(MRP):
        
    def init(self):
        self.store = True
        self.Œ£V   = self.V*0      #¬†the sum of returns for all episodes
        self.Œ£epV = self.V*0      #¬†counts for numbers of times we add to the return  

    # ----------------------------- üåò offline, MC learning: end-of-episode learning üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ --------------------------------    
    # MC1stVisit average all past visits to a state in all episodes to get its return estimates
    # we simply override the offline() function of the parent class
    def offline(self):

        #initialise the values
        Vs = self.V*0
        epV= self.V*0

        # obtain the return for the latest episode
        Gt = 0
        for t in range(self.t, -1, -1):
            s = self.s[t]
            rn = self.r[t+1]

            Gt = self.Œ≥*Gt + rn
            Vs[s] = Gt
            epV[s] = 1

        # add the counts to the experience and obtain the average as per MC estimates
        self.Œ£V   += Vs
        self.Œ£epV += epV
        ind = epV>0 # avoids /0
        self.V[ind] = self.Œ£V[ind]/self.Œ£epV[ind] 
        

```


## MRP with visualisation

To help us to visualize the learning that is taking place in each episode, we have created a set of visualization functions that we will add to the MRP class. Familiarize yourself with these functions, they are self-explanatory. Mainly we have one function for plotting after each episode, not surprisingly called plot_ep(), and another function called plot_exp() that will be called at the end of the experience (after finishing all episodes). In addition, we have an Error() function to calculate the RMSE  between the true values and the predicted values of the states as well as plot_V() function that visualises the predicted values and true values to see visually how the algorithm is doing to come closer towards the true values.

As we did with the Grid class, we will call the child name the same name as the parent (MRP) to help us keep the code consistent and simplify the treatments of our classes when we import a class. The downside is that you would have to re-execute the first parent and its subsequent children if you want to make some changes to the class since it will keep adding to previous definitions, so please be mindful of this point.

We have also tried to reduce the overhead as much as possible for the new class by setting up visualisation only when it is necessary (when one of the plot functions is called)


### Applying MC1st on a prediction problem

Let us now run MC1st with the latest useful visualisation.

```python
mc = MC1st(env=randwalk(), episodes=100, plotV=True, plotE=True, seed=1).interact()
```
    
![png](output_40_0.png)
    


As you can see we have called 
MC = MC1st(MRP)
to make sure that we are dealing with latest MRP definition.


Ok one more thing, to avoid passing the value of plotE=True, plotV=True, animate=True, whenever we want to demo a prediction algorithm, we can create a dictionary and store these values in it and then pass the reference to the MC1st call, below we show how.


```python
demoV = {'plotE':True, 'plotV':True, 'animate':True} # suitable for prediction
```


```python
mc = MC1st(episodes=100, **demoV, seed=1).interact()
```

    
![png](output_46_0.png)
    

## MDP environment for control

Let us now extend our MRP class to deal with control. We would need to deal with the Q action-value function instead of the value function V. Also lacking is a set of non-stationary policies that allows us to take advantage of the Q action-value function. Below we show this implementation. 

We also use a class factory to define our MDP class. Doing so will save us from redefining the class again when we amend our MRP class. We will need to amend the MRP when we change the state representation to use function approximation in the next unit.

The q0 is the initial set of values we might want to set up for all our Q estimates. We can also opt for completely random values for each action-value pair, we have left this out for simplicity of the coverage, but you can try it yourself.  Œµ is the percentage of time we want our agent to explore. 

The class defines a set of policy-related functions that revolve around the Œµ-greedy policy. We have implemented a simple, deterministic greedy policy that always chooses the first max Q action greedy_(). The main difference between greedy_() and Œµgreedy() for Œµ=0 is that the latter stochastically chooses between multiple *optimum* actions with the same action-value function. This is useful when we use exploration by optimistic initialisation since the greedy_() function can cause action starvation (a phenomenon where the action is never selected). Nevertheless, greedy_() is useful to test the optimality of a learned policy (once learning finishes) and is used within œÄisoptimal() function.

The œÄisoptimal() function returns whether the current policy is optimal by checking if the agent can reach the goal in a predefined number of steps stored in self.Tstar. The œÄ() function returns the probability of taking a certain action under the Œµ-greedy policy. Finally, the render() function deals with rendering a policy.

We used a class factory for MDP. This is because we want our class to be flexible later to accommodate for changes in the MRP parent class. That is if we change the MRP class in later lessons we do not need to restate the MDP definition to inherit from the new MRP class, instead we just pass MDP(MRP) where MRP will be taken as the latest definition. This is will be appreciated in later lessons.

## First-visit MC control 

Now we extend this class to overload the offline function to offload it with our 1st-visit Monte Carlo method for control.


```python
class MC1stControl(MDP()):
        
    def init(self):
        self.store = True
        self.Œ£Q   = self.Q*0      #¬†the sum of returns for all episodes
        self.Œ£epQ = self.Q*0      #¬†counts for numbers of times we add to the return  
    
    def offline(self): 
        #initialise the values
        Qs = self.Q*0
        epQ= self.Q*0
        
        # obtain the return for the latest episode
        Gt = 0
        for t in range(self.t, -1, -1):
            s = self.s[t]
            a = self.a[t]
            rn = self.r[t+1]
            
            Gt = self.Œ≥*Gt + rn
            Qs[s,a] = Gt
            epQ[s,a] = 1

        # add the counts to the experience and obtain the average as per MC estimates
        self.Œ£Q   += Qs
        self.Œ£epQ += epQ
        ind = epQ>0 # avoid /0
        self.Q[ind] = self.Œ£Q[ind]/self.Œ£epQ[ind] 

```

### Applying MC on a control problem

Similar to what we did for prediction, we get help from a dictionary that stores a set of useful configurations that we use often. In the case of control, the most useful is plotting the number of steps the agent took to reach a terminal state in each episode or the sum of rewards the agent collected in each episode. Each one of these plots can be useful for certain tasks. Bear in mind that if the reward is given only for reaching the goal location or terminal state, the sum of the rewards plot would be a constant line that does not convey useful information. Below we show each.


Unfortunately, applying the MC control algorithm with the default reward function will not yield a useful policy. This is because the explore-start condition is not satisfied (refer to section 5.4 of our book). In addition, averaging solutions may not perform well because they do not track a changing policy well for non-stationary problems (most of the control problems are non-stationary). To see this, uncomment the lines in the cell below and run it. (Note that we have set up the priorities of the actions in a way that will show this issue (right comes before left and down before up). demoQ is a dicitonary that passes visualisaiton values to the MDP control algorithm.


```python
mc = MC1stControl(env=grid(), Œ≥=1, episodes=200,  seed=10, **demoQ()).interact()
```

![png](output_67_0.png)
    


### The role of the discount factor $\gamma$ for delayed reward
**Important Note**
It is always the case that when we use a *delayed reward* (which is the default reward for our Grid class), the discount factor $\gamma$ **must not be set to 1**. This is because the sum of the discounted rewards of each visited state will be equal to the delayed reward itself, which will not give any particular advantage to follow a shorter path, yielding a useless policy. Therefore, we can solve this issue 
1. either by providing a discounted value for $\gamma$ that < 1.
1. or by changing the reward to have intermediate steps reward, which, when accumulated, will provide distinguished sums for the different paths and hence help distinguish the shortest path or the policy that will yield an optimal reward.

### Solution 1
Below we show how we can simply reduce $\gamma$ to solve this issue.


```python
mc = MC1stControl(env=grid(), Œ≥=.99, episodes=30, seed=10, **demoTR()).interact()
```


    
![png](output_70_0.png)
    


### Solution 2
Also we can compensate for the above issue, we would need to set up a reward function that allows the agent to quickly realise when it stuck in some not useful policy.


```python
env1 = grid(reward='reward_1')
mcc = MC1stControl(env=env1, episodes=30, seed=0, **demoTR()).interact()
```


    
![png](output_72_0.png)
    


Compare the above policy with the one produced by the DP solution in lesson 2. You will notice that the MC solution does not give a comprehensive solution from all states because we do not start from different cells. The starting position is fixed. The exploration nature of the policy allowed the agent to develop an *understanding* through its Q function of where it should head if it finds itself in a specific cell. The Markovian property is essential in guaranteeing that this can be safely assumed.

You might have noticed that although the task is very straightforward, the agent detoured a bit from the simplest straight path that leads to the goal. Bear in mind that we are adopting an Œµgreedy policy by default, which means that the agent will take some explorative actions 10% of the time. But this should not have prevented the maxQ policy from pointing towards the goal. This is because of the nature of MC itself and its sampling averages. The next section demonstrates how we can overcome this difficulty.

We can play with the exploration but that is needs lots of trail and is not straightforward.

```python
mc = MC1stControl(env=grid(), Œ≥=.97, episodes=50, Œµ=.5, dŒµ=.99, seed=20, **demoTR()).interact()
```

![png](output_76_0.png)


```python
mcc = MC1stControl(env=grid(reward='reward_1'), Œ≥=.97, episodes=100, Œµ=0.9, dŒµ=.999, seed=20, **demoTR()).interact()
```
    
![png](output_78_0.png)
    

## Incremental constant-Œ± MC: Every-visit MC Prediction


```python
class MC(MRP):

    def init(self):
        self.store = True

    # ----------------------------- üåò offline, MC learning: end-of-episode learning ----------------------    
    def offline(self):
        # obtain the return for the latest episode
        Gt = 0
        for t in range(self.t, -1, -1):
            s = self.s[t]
            rn = self.r[t+1]
            
            Gt = self.Œ≥*Gt + rn
            self.V[s] += self.Œ±*(Gt - self.V[s])
```

This type of algorithmic design is more flexible and will be used in general in RL instead of the implementation that requires storing the sums or averages.

<!-- ### Apply incremental MC on prediction problem -->

Let us try our new shiny prediction algorithm on the random walk problem.


```python
mc = MC( Œ±=.02, episodes=50, **demoV()).interact()
```
    
![png](output_101_0.png)
    


Notice how jumpy the MC is.

## Incremental MCC: Every-visit MC Control


```python
# note that the name has double C: we are dealing with MC+Control
class MCC(MDP()):

    def init(self):
        self.store = True

    # ---------------------------- üåò offline, MC learning: end-of-episode learning üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ -----------------------    
    def offline(self):  
        # obtain the return for the latest episode
        Gt = 0
        for t in range(self.t, -1, -1):
            s = self.s[t]
            a = self.a[t]
            rn = self.r[t+1]

            Gt = self.Œ≥*Gt + rn
            self.Q[s,a] += self.Œ±*(Gt - self.Q[s,a])
```


```python
mcc = MCC(env=grid(reward='reward1'), Œ±=.2, episodes=1, seed=0, **demoQ()).interact()
```
    
![png](output_105_0.png)
    

<!-- ### Apply incremental MC on control problem -->


As we can see, although we solved the issue of tracking a non-stationary policy when we used a constant learning rate Œ±, and we tried to use a reward function that gives immediate feedback to each step instead of a delayed reward, but still the performance is not as good as we wished for. This is due to our final issue, which is the action precedence that we set up to prefer left over right. If we change this precedence, it will help the agent to immediately find the goal, however, we set it up this way to make the problem more challenging. Consider changing this precedence to see the effect.


## REINFORCE: MC for Policy Gradient

So far, we have only seen how to estimate a value function to deduce a policy from this value function and then improve the policy by preferring a greedy action with a bit of exploration (as in Œµ-greedy policy). When we allow the agent to act according to this new policy, its value function might change, so we must re-estimate the value function. We go into iterations of this process until the policy and value function are both stable (converge). We also saw that we could integrate both operations seamlessly into one iteration, as in the value-iteration algorithm in Dynamic Programming. We can even do both stages in one *step* as in Q-learning or Sarsa, as we shall see in the next lesson. The policy improvement theorem and the Generalised Policy Iteration process guarantee all of this. The primary approach we took to achieve learning for an **action-value** method is to **minimise an error function** between our estimate of a value function and the actual value function. Since the real value function is unavailable, we replaced it with some samples (unbiased as in MC and biased as in TD that we will see later).

**Policy gradient** algorithms, on the other hand, attempt to **maximise an objective function** instead of minimising an error function. 
Can you think of a function that, if we maximise, will help us solve the RL problem...? pause for a moment and think.

As you might have guessed, the value function can be used as an objective function. The objective here is to change the policy to maximise the value function. 

Directly estimating the policy means we are not using a value function to express the policy as in the e-greedy. Instead, we are using the value function to learn the policy directly. So, our algorithm does not need to learn the value function explicitly; it can learn a set of parameters that will maximise the value function without knowing what the value function is. It will come as a consequence of learning a policy. In the same way that we did not need to learn a policy in the value-function approach, we learned a value function, and as a consequence of minimising the error, we can deduce a policy from the learned value function. This is the fundamental difference between value function approaches and policy gradient approaches.

Estimating the policy directly means we do not need to restrict the policy parameters to value function estimates and their ranges. The policy parameters that represent the preferences to select an action are free to take on any range of values as long as they comparatively form a cohesive policy that maximises the value function by dictating which action to choose in a specific state. This is a major advantage because the value function is strictly tied to the sum of rewards values, while a policy need not have this coupling. This will give us more freedom in using classification architectures when we use function approximation which excels in deducing the best action for a state, instead of using a regression architecture to regress a value function which is usually more prone to initial condition issues and are harder to train.

The best policy representation in a policy gradient method is the action selection softmax policy we came across in our last few lessons. This is a smooth function that, unlike Œµ-greedy, allows the changes in the probabilities to be continuous and integrates very well with policy gradient methods. One of the significant advantages of policy gradient methods (the policy is differentiable everywhere, unlike stepwise Œµ-greedy functions) is that it provides better guarantees of convergence than Œµ-greedy due to this smoothness (Œµ-greedy can change abruptly due to small changes in the action-value functions, while softmax just smoothly increases or decrease the probability of selecting ana action when its action-value function changes).

We start our coverage for policy gradient methods with an offline method; REINFORCE. REINFORCE is an algorithm that takes a *policy gradient* approach instead of an action-value function approach. The idea is simple, given that an episode provides a sample of returns for the visited states, at the end of an episode, we will take the values of the states and use them to guide our search to find the optimal policy that maximises the value function. 

**Note** that policy gradient sections in this lesson, and the next are based on chapter 13 of our book. They can be read as they appear in the notebook or delayed until the end of lesson 9.


### Policy Gradient Class
The softmax is the default policy selection procedure for Policy Gradient methods. $\tau$ acts like an exploration factor (more on that later) and we need to one-hot encoding for the actions.

Ok, so now we are ready to define our REINFORCE algorithm. This algorithm and other policy gradient algorithm always have two updates, one for V and one for Q. In other words, the action-value function update will be guided by the state-value update. We usually call the first update deals that with V, the critic and the second update that deals with Q the actor.


```python
class REINFORCE(PG()):
    
    def init(self):
        self.store = True

    # -------------------- üåò offline, REINFORCE: MC for policy gradient methdos ----------------------
    def offline(self):
        œÄ, Œ≥, Œ±, œÑ = self.œÄ, self.Œ≥, self.Œ±, self.œÑ
        # obtain the return for the latest episode
        Gt = 0
        Œ≥t = Œ≥**self.t                  # efficient way to calculate powers of Œ≥ backwards
        for t in range(self.t, -1, -1): # reversed to make it easier to calculate Gt
            s = self.s[t]
            a = self.a[t]
            rn = self.r[t+1]
            
            Gt = Œ≥*Gt + rn
            Œ¥ = Gt - self.V[s]
            
            self.V[s]   += Œ±*Œ¥
            self.Q[s,a] += Œ±*Œ¥*(1 - œÄ(s,a))*Œ≥t/œÑ
            Œ≥t /= Œ≥

```

## The Role of Discount Factor $\gamma$ in Policy Gradient Methods
$\gamma$ seems to play a more important role in policy gradient methods than in action-value methods.
The next few examples show how $\gamma$ can make the difference between convergence and divergence.
The main issue is, as usual, whether the *reward* is delayed or there is an intermediate reward. If the reward is delayed, we would need to assign $\gamma$ values that are < 1 so that the sum of the rewards is discounted, which helps the agent differentiate between longer and shorter paths solution. However, $\gamma$ also plays a role in convergence when the reward is not delayed. It complements the role that $\tau$ plays in the SoftMax policy. Therefore, instead of tuning $\tau$ we can reduce $\gamma$ specifically when the goal reward is 0, and the intermediate reward is -1 (reward_0) function. Let us see some examples:

Below we increase the value of $\tau$ to deal with this issue of diveregnce.


```python
reinforce = REINFORCE(env=grid(reward='reward0'), Œ±=.1, œÑ=2, Œ≥=1, episodes=100, seed=10 , **demoQ()).interact()
```
    
![png](output_135_0.png)
    

As we can see REINFORCE converged when we increase $\tau$ which helped the values in SoftMax to become appropriatly smaller to help the algorithm to converge.

Let us now decrease the value of $\gamma<1$ and keep $\tau=1$


```python
reinforce = REINFORCE(env=grid(reward='reward0'), Œ±=.1, œÑ=1, Œ≥=.98, episodes=100, seed=10, **demoQ()).interact()
```

As we can see decreasing $\gamma$ helped REINFORCE immensely to converge. Although the reward that we used is 'reward_1' which is not delayed, but discounting the return helped the value function to be more meaningful for the problem in hand which helped in turn the policy to be more appropriate for the problem in hand.  

Let us now increase $\tau$ and keep $\gamma<1$ this will reveal another role for $\tau$.


```python
reinforce = REINFORCE(env=grid(reward='reward0'), Œ±=.1, œÑ=2, Œ≥=.98, episodes=100, seed=10, **demoQ()).interact()
```

As we can see increasing $\tau$ while using $\gamma <1$ did not help. We will mostly therefore use $\gamma <1$ for our policy gradient methods.  


Note how exploration lead to a fully covered environment but to a slower convergence.

## Conclusion
In this lesson, we studied the properties of Monte Carlo algorithms for prediction and control. We started by covering a basic first visit MC method that averages the returns similar to what we did in lesson 1, this time for the associative problem (i.e., when we have states that we select specific actions for, un-associated problems do not have states and have been studied in lesson 1). We have then created an incremental MC algorithm that allows us to average the returns in a step-by-step manner. To that end, we have developed an essential MRP class that will carry the step-by-step and episode-by-episode interaction with an MRP environment, and then we added a useful set of visualisation routines. We have further inherited the MRP class in an MDP class that defines policies that depend on the Q function to obtain a suitable policy for an agent (i.e., control).
We noted that MC needed to wait until the episode was finished to carry out updates. In the next unit, we will study full online algorithms that mitigate this shortcoming of MC with the cost of bootstrapping. We will be using the MRP and MDP classes that we developed here.
